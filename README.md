# Course Grade Calculator

The [Course Grade Calculator](https://course-grade-calculator.herokuapp.com) is designed to aid the college student in determining their current or forseeable grade in an enrolled course.

The web application calculates the grade percentage from a list of items and item group that contain information corresponding to graded course items.

## How to use

Use the **Add Item** button to add a new row for an individual item. This is used for graded items that have their own specified weight (i.e. exams).

Delete items by clicking on the `×` button to the right of the item.

Use the **Add Group** button to add a new item group. This is used for a group of items that belong to a single section with an evenly distributed weight (i.e. homeworks, quizzes).

Add more group items by clicking on **Add Item** to the right of the leading row of the group.

Delete the group by clicking on the `×` button to the right of the leading row of the group.

Fill in all fields approriate for each item to calculate the final grade. Any fields that are left empty will **not** be included in the final grade calculation.
